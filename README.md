- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JacksonVirgo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing websites and tools to help in the tedious aspects of my own life and perhaps many more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create full-stack web applications with Node and React.

My current project I am working on is a tool I am calling Mafia Engine. It's split between multiple sub-projects but the core is to aid in the playing and hosting of online mafia/werewolf games. It currently has a forum scraper and discord bot port.
